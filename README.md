SORS
====

System for organization and realization of competitions (in bulgarian it abbreviates into SORS).
The second project I worked on - tried to make it object-oriented, used CodeIgniter.

The project needs a database which is provided in the database.sql file.
Access to the database can be modified in application/config/database.php.

The project is designed so that it can create and manage competitions. 
If you use the database.sql database you can log in as an admin with the username orokhan and the password 123.
If not you have to create an administrator account manually through the database.
You also have to create the first competition manually throught the database but you can later edit it through SORS.
